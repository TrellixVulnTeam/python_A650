1. PEM key we download when we create our server instance is what gives us permission to SSH (Secure Shell) into our server.
   Never put your PEM key on GitHub or in any other way share your PEM key.

2. There are three basic functions you will need to set up when you add Gunicorn to your project. To add this functionality, Gunicorn needs some instructions on how to do the following:

	Which socket to connect to
	What to do if a process fails
	How many workers to set up

3 . chmod 400 secret_key.pem
    ssh -i "secret_key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-16-207-110.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['ubuntu@ec2-3-16-207-110.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com']	# keep the quotes!
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static/")	# add this line at the bottom; don't replace any existing lines!
